>The format of GNU MO files</H1
><P
>This section was last updated august 2nd, 2003 by copying
the appropriate section from the GNU gettext manual.</P
><P
>The format of the generated MO files is best described by a picture,
which appears below.</P
><P
>The first two words serve the identification of the file.  The magic
number will always signal GNU MO files.  The number is stored in the
byte order of the generating machine, so the magic number really is
two numbers: <SPAN
CLASS="KEYCODE"
>0x950412de</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="KEYCODE"
>0xde120495</SPAN
>.  The second
word describes the current revision of the file format.  For now the
revision is 0.  This might change in future versions, and ensures
that the readers of MO files can distinguish new formats from old
ones, so that both can be handled correctly.  The version is kept
separate from the magic number, instead of using different magic
numbers for different formats, mainly because <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/magic</TT
> is
not updated often.  It might be better to have magic separated from
internal format version identification.</P
><P
>Follow a number of pointers to later tables in the file, allowing
for the extension of the prefix part of MO files without having to
recompile programs reading them.  This might become useful for later
inserting a few flag bits, indication about the charset used, new
tables, or other things.</P
><P
>Then, at offset <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>O</TT
> and offset <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>T</TT
> in the picture, two tables
of string descriptors can be found.  In both tables, each string
descriptor uses two 32 bits integers, one for the string length,
another for the offset of the string in the MO file, counting in bytes
from the start of the file.  The first table contains descriptors
for the original strings, and is sorted so the original strings
are in increasing lexicographical order.  The second table contains
descriptors for the translated strings, and is parallel to the first
table: to find the corresponding translation one has to access the
array slot in the second array with the same index.</P
><P
>Having the original strings sorted enables the use of simple binary
search, for when the MO file does not contain an hashing table, or
for when it is not practical to use the hashing table provided in
the MO file.  This also has another advantage, as the empty string
in a PO file GNU <SPAN
CLASS="KEYCODE"
>gettext</SPAN
> is usually translated into
some system information attached to that particular MO file, and the
empty string necessarily becomes the first in both the original and
translated tables, making the system information very easy to find.</P
><P
>The size <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>S</TT
> of the hash table can be zero.  In this case, the
hash table itself is not contained in the MO file.  Some people might
prefer this because a precomputed hashing table takes disk space, and
does not win that much speed.  The hash table contains indices
to the sorted array of strings in the MO file.  Conflict resolution is
done by double hashing.  The precise hashing algorithm used is fairly
dependent on GNU <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gettext</TT
> code, and is not documented here.</P
><P
>As for the strings themselves, they follow the hash file, and each
is terminated with a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUL</TT
>, and this <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUL</TT
> is not counted in
the length which appears in the string descriptor.  The <SPAN
CLASS="KEYCODE"
>msgfmt</SPAN
></P
><P
>program has an option selecting the alignment for MO file strings.
With this option, each string is separately aligned so it starts at
an offset which is a multiple of the alignment value.  On some RISC
machines, a correct alignment will speed things up.</P
><P
>Plural forms are stored by letting the plural of the original string
follow the singular of the original string, separated through a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUL</TT
> byte.  The length which appears in the string descriptor
includes both.  However, only the singular of the original string
takes part in the hash table lookup.  The plural variants of the
translation are all stored consecutively, separated through a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUL</TT
> byte. Here also, the length in the string descriptor 
includes all of them. </P
><P
>Nothing prevents a MO file from having embedded <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUL</TT
>s in strings. 
However, the program interface currently used already presumes 
that strings are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUL</TT
> terminated, so embedded <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUL</TT
>s are 
somewhat useless.  But the MO file format is general enough so other 
interfaces would be later possible, if for example, we ever want to 
implement wide characters right in MO files, where <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUL</TT
> bytes may 
accidently appear.  (No, we don't want to have wide characters in MO 
files.  They would make the file unnecessarily large, and the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>wchar_t</TT
>
type being platform dependent, MO files would be 
platform dependent as well.) </P
><P
>This particular issue has been strongly debated in the GNU 
<SPAN
CLASS="KEYCODE"
>gettext</SPAN
> development forum, and it is expectable that MO file 
format will evolve or change over time.  It is even possible that many 
formats may later be supported concurrently.  But surely, we have to 
start somewhere, and the MO file format described here is a good start. 
Nothing is cast in concrete, and the format may later evolve fairly 
easily, so we should feel comfortable with the current approach.</P
