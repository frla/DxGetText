dxEdit is a Delphi GUI application to simplify working with PO files in Delphi. Note that Troy Wolbrink's TNT Controls (http://home.ccci.org/wolbrink/tnt/delphi_unicode_controls.htm) are needed to open the project in Delphi and compile the program.

Currently, it can do next to nothing, but the following are some of the ideas for it:

po files:
* create
* update (add new strings)
* delete (?)

po file entries (and comments):
* add
* edit
* delete (?)
* find

languages:
* create (copy po file and create folder structure)
* update (add new strings)
* delete (?)

parsing:
* parse pas, dfm, rc files (i.e dxgettext)
* parse dfn/rc files (i.e dfntopo)
* parse ITE xml files (i.e ixtopo)

misc:
* compile mo (i.e msgfmt)
* remove duplicate entries in po files 
* sort po files
* merge po files (i.e msgmerge)
