Windows 2003 incompatibility with some Delphi versions
======================================================
There is a bug in some Delphi versions related to Windows 20003
and the SysUtils.GetEnvironmentVariable() function call, which
is used by dxgettext. In order to fix it, open SysUtils.pas
(delphi\Source\Rtl\Sys) and replace the GetEnvironmentVariable
function with the following:

function GetEnvironmentVariable(const Name: string): string;
var
Len: integer;
W : String;
begin
Result := '';
SetLength(W,1);
Len := GetEnvironmentVariable(PChar(Name), PChar(W), 1);
if Len > 0 then
begin
SetLength(Result, Len - 1);
GetEnvironmentVariable(PChar(Name), PChar(Result), Len);
end;
end;
