>Here you can see, that it first searches <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>default.mo</TT
> for a translation, but doesn't
find one. Because it's a resourcestring translation, and because we specified the "delphi" textdomain to be searched
for resourcestrings, it decides to try out delphi.mo. This file has not been opened, yet, and therefore
the file is opened at this point, and the full filename is written to the log file. The first action when opening
a new .mo file is to check wether the Content-Type is set to use utf-8. Once it found out that this is the case,
it looks up "OK" in the delphi.mo file, and finds the Danish "O.k." translation.</P

>Log-files can be huge if your program runs for a long time. If that happens, load the logfile into an editor
that is capable of handling huge files, and search for the keywords that you saw in this section.</P
><P
>If your program breaks because a string property is translated that shouldn't, try to search for the
Exception error message in the log file (error messages are translated, too, and are also mentioned in the
log file). The last translation mentioned before that error mesage is probably the one that made your program fail.</P
><P
>When you have identified a property that should not be translated, you can either specify it globally
that it should not be translated, by calling <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>TP_GlobalIgnoreClassProperty()</TT

disable it only for the next call to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
