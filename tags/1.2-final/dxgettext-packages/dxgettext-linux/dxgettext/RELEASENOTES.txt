Release notes
=============

Command line tools
==================
Tools like msgmerge, msgfmt, msgunfmt, msgcat etc. are part of all normal
Linux distributions and are therefore not included in this package.

If they are not present already, you should install them from your Linux
distribution. If you Linux distribution is package-based, like most of them
are, the package is most likely named "gettext-devel" or something similar.


Freepascal users
================
Have a look in the freepascal subdirectory.


C/C++ users
===========
Please read CPPBUILDER.txt
