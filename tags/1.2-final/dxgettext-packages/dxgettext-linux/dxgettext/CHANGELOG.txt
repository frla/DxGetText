Version 1.2 (2005-03-27)
========================
- Fixed a long time bug in dxgettext, where non-identifiers might be identified as identifiers. This should reduce the number of warnings displayed when scanning source code.

Version 1.2 Release Candidate 2 (2005-03-22)
============================================
Tools changes:
- The following app do no longer require write access to files they only read: dxgettext
- poparser.pas now has filemode:=fmOpenRead
- Upgraded version number to "1.2 RC 2"

gnugettext.pas changes:
- The non-member procedure TranslateProperties, which was not accessible outside the gnugettextpas unit, has been removed from the file.
- Removed exception when using DebugLogToFile() without having set DXGETTEXTDEBUG
- The ansi versions of _() etc. have been removed from gnugettext.pas
- gnugettext.pas now automatically converts the old 'no' language code to the correct 'nb' when Windows reports 'no'
- Reimplemented the way environment variables are retrieved because Delphi's RTL isn't 100% Windows 2003 compatible
- Fixed the rare case, where a resourcestring is an empty string. This should be translated to an empty string.
- Fixed lack of initialization of lang local variable in TGnuGettextInstance.Create
- Added const to more string parameters of procedures and functions in order to improve speed
- Fixed _(#0) problem

Version 1.2 Release Candidate 1 (2004-02-19)
============================================
- Finally fixed the multithreading bug that was present in many of the 1.2 beta versions

Version 1.2 beta 5 (2003-12-27)
===============================
- Bugfix: TranslateComponent() traversal across owners is now like in beta 3 and before.
- All command line tools now have non-zero exit codes if they fail. This is good for scripting.
- TranslateStrings() now calls TStrings.BeginUpdate and TStrings.EndUpdate.

Version 1.2 beta 4 (2003-12-14)
===============================
- If debugging is enabled, a message is displayed at program start.
- Most likely fixed LoadResString multithreading protection mechanism
- Improved shell integration for .ocx, .dll and .bpl files
- Fixed problem with embedding translations
- Error reporting when reading .po files now reports linenumbers
- Added support for FreePascal
- TranslateComponent() no longer recurses into TComponent properties that have
  a different owner. This solves the "translation across forms" problem. It
  should not break backwards compatibility except for very few cases, where
  something is not translated. Please report any problem you might see.

Version 1.2 beta 3 (2003-11-25)
===============================
- Introduced DesignTimeCodePage, which allows non-ascii translations to run on Windows machines with different code pages than the designtime codepage

- Improved dublicate TP_GlobalIgnoreProperty() error message
- Improved debug log output
- Added --useignorepo option to dxgettext

- Fixed the incorrect character set survival mechanism
- Added documentation
