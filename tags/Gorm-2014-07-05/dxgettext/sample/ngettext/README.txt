This directory contains an example of how to use the ngettext() function.

Please note, that translations for this requires a special syntax that is not
support by neither poedit nor kbabel. Also, the ngettext() value will not be extracted
by dxgettext.

You should not look at this sample unless you know what ngettext() is.
